This is my list of undergrad programs in Classics, mainly in the US and Canada, but also containing a few from elsewhere.

## Submitting Changes
I'll happily take updates via [email](mailto:john@muccigrosso.org), but please feel free to fork and make pull requests to update info. Please edit **only** the markdown (.md) file. (The html is generated from it via pandoc, and I won't accept any changes to it. Keeping it here allows archiving via github.) [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a fairly simple markup language, so even if you've never used it before, you can probably figure out how it works.
